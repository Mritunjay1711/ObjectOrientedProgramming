STL = Containers + Algo + Iterators

    
    Containers-> Objects which store data
    Algo -> Procedure to process data
    Iterators -> Object which points to an elements of a Containers

Container -> Sequence Containers -> Linear fashion O->O->O -> Vector, List, DEQueue
          -> Associative Containers -> Direct Access -> Set/Multiset, Map/Multimap
          -> Derived Containers -> Real world modelling -> Stack, Queue, PQueue


Sequence Containers
    1. Vector -> RA(Random Access) = Fast
                 Insertion/Del in middle = slow
                 Insertion at the end = fast
    2. List -> RA = slow
               Insertion/Del in middle = fast
               Insertion/Del at end = fast

Associative Containers
        -> All operation fast except RA

Derived Containers
        -> Depends -> Data Structure
